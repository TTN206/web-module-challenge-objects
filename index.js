The function should:
  1. Receive values for the object that will be created as parameters
  2. Create and return an object using the received values 
  
  Example createMenuItem('tacos', 8, 'Lunch') should return {name: 'tacos', price: 8, category: 'Lunch'}

  2. Create at least 3 menu items (objects) of your choosing making sure they have name, price, and category keys

You're having a lunch special! 25% off for teachers and students, 10% off for everyone else. Add a method to the 
burger object below that automatically calculates price depending on the a string received as a parameter. 

Using the burger object below do the following:
  1. Add a method called discount to the burger object 
  2. The discount method should accept a string as a parameter (example: "teacher", "student", or "public")
  3. Depending on the string, it will return the correct discounted price
  4. Check your work by invoking the function and passing in 'teacher', 'student', or 'public' as your arguments to ensure they are returning the correct price.

  For example: burger.discount("teacher") would return 13.5 and burger.discount("public") would return 16.2

This stretch goal does not use the reviews data!  You create your own object in this stretch goal.

Use the carMaker function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a value representing the odometer (how many miles it's been driven) and use that when creating the object
  2. Create a drive method inside the object that increases the odometer value
  3. Return the object
  4. The returned object with the odometer value should have the following characteristics:
     a. The drive method which, when called, takes a distance value as its parameter
     b. The drive method should also cause the odometer value in the object to be increased by the distance
     c. Then the drive method should return the updated value of the odometer

  For example: Let's say we created the object in the variable car1 with an odometer value of 10.
  Then we called car1.drive(100)
  It would return 110 because it was created with 10 as the odometer and we added 100 to it with the drive method
